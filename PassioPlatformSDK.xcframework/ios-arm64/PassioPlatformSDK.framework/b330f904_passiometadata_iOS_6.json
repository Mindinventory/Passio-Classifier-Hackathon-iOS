K. S. Iyengar's 1966 Light on Yoga grades it as level 32 out of 60.In the basic pose, the body is balanced as in headstand, but the legs are bent and the back is lightly arched, and the head is lifted from the ground so the body is supported only by the forearms.A more advanced variant has the back arched further so the feet touch the top of the head.A second advanced variant has the legs held straight out horizontally above the head and arms, resembling the scorpion's tail stretched in a threat posture forwards over its body.The pose can also be executed in a variant with straight arms.Whether resting on forearms (Pincha Mayurasana) or with arms in handstand, the asana can be worked towards with the use of a chair to support the feet.\nLight on Yoga distinguishes Vrischikasana I (forearm balance, feet on head, plates 536 and 537) and Vrischikasana II (handstand, feet on head, plate 538), describing the second as an \"\"extremely difficult\"\" balance. The placing of the feet on the head is stated to indicate an attempt to subjugate the ego with its \"\"deadly\"\" scorpionlike emotions.\nIn 2022, the Indian yoga teacher Yash Moradiya held Vrischikasana for 29 minutes and 4 seconds, as measured by Guinness World Records in Dubai.","synonyms":{"en":[{"synonymId":"8a64c558-4925-11ed-ab03-d285573c59a1","synonym":"feathered peacock"},{"synonymId":"86379307-4925-11ed-ab03-d285573c59a1","synonym":"पिञ्चमयूरासन"},{"synonymId":"7adea374-4925-11ed-ab03-d285573c59a1","synonym":"pincha mayurasana"}]},"models":["1b2cb912-492b-11ed-a1a4-56d3da4afdc3"]},"1003765":{"labelId":"8769c7be-4925-11ed-ab03-d285573c59a1","path":"1003765","displayName":"shavasana","description":"\"Shavasana and some sitting asanas maintain the balance between relaxation and meditation (two key components of yoga) by their equal input of physical stimuli.\nShavasana is performed on the back with the legs spread as wide as the yoga mat and arms relaxed to both the sides of the body, and the eyes closed. The whole body is relaxed on the floor with an awareness of the chest and abdomen rising and falling with each breath. During Shavasana, all parts of the body are scanned for muscular tension of any kind. Any muscular tension the body finds is consciously released as it is found. All control of the breath, the mind, and the body is then released for the duration of the asana. Shavasana is typically practiced for 5–10 minutes at the end of an asana practice, but can be practiced for 20–30 minutes.In Sivananda yoga, it is practised not only for \"\"Final Relaxation\"\" at the end of a session, but before the session and between asanas.\nThe asana is released by slowly deepening the breath, flexing the fingers and toes, reaching the arms above the head, stretching the whole body, and exhaling while bringing the knees to the chest and rolling over to the side in a fetal position, drawing the head in the right arm. From here, one can push up into a seated position. Drowsiness or restlessness of the mind while in Shavasana may be counteracted by increasing the rate and depth of breathing.
